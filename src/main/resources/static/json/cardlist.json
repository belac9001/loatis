The attack will travel its full distance, regardless of how many enemies it travels through, until it hits a solid wall or object. Any creature behind the first must make a Dexterity saving throw or take the damage as well."

On a fail, they are pulled towards the center in a straight line. This movement does not trigger Attacks of Opportunity. If a creature collides with solid objects or other creatures this way, it takes an additional Deck Die of bludgeoning damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn."
